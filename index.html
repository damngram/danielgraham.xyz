							<h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
							<p>I have eight semesters experience as a teaching assistant at the college level where I led hour-long lectures and recitations, held one-on-one office hours, and created tests quizzes and problem sets. I'm familiar with curricula for both high school and university level chemistry, and I'm confident that my knowledge base and past experiences will allow me to lead engaging lessons in both settings.</p>
							<p>Before I was offered my current job, I was preparing to apply for lectureship positions at the college level.  As part of that preparation, I read the book "<a href="https://makeitstick.net/">Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning</a>, which summarizes the latest findings from cognitive science research into the most effective methods of learning."  I'm interested in using the scientifically proven methods of frequent, low-stakes testing, the interweaving of new and past topics, and demonstration of real-world applications to maximize retention of material. I want to give my students a base of knowledge that they can not only use in future studies of chemistry, but also to add a layer of understanding to all other studies in science, medicine, and even art.</p>

							<h2>Industrial Experience</h2>
							<p>Since graduating from Harvard in the spring of 2015, I have worked at a respected chemical company, Oakwood Products Inc in Estill, SC. I'm responsible for synthesizing fine chemicals for use by pharmaceutical companies and academic labs.  I specialize in the systhesis and purification of organic isocyanates, isothiocyanates, and acid chlorides on the kilogram scale, but I've made dozens of random chemicals to fill orders. Other responsibilities of mine include managing small teams in large scale (>50 kg) syntheses, corresponding with customers,  and managing our air- and water-free glovebox where we package our sensitive products. I'm experienced in a variety of analytical techniques including GC, GC/MS, NMR, and HPLC.</p>

							<h2>Education</h2>
							<p>As an undergraduate, I studied at Brandeis University in Waltham, MA where I received a BA and MS in Chemistry.  While there, I performed a combined three years of research with Oleg V. Ozerov (now at Texas A&M) and Christine M. Thomas (now at Ohio State University). My undergraduate research focussed on the synthesis and reactivity of air and moisture sensitive transition metal complexes. I was a teaching assistant for laboratory classes in organic and inorganic chemistry.</p>
							<p>I started my graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  While there, I completed all of the required coursework and qualifications to pursue a PhD.  Even after my research group relocated to Harvard, I enjoyed research collaborations with MIT professors until the end of my time in graduate school. While at MIT, I was a teaching assistant for advanced general chemistry and introductory inorganic chemistry.</p>
							<p> In the winter of 2013, my graduate research advisor, Daniel G. Nocera, was hired by Harvard University. Together with the rest of my research group members, I moved the two miles up Massachusetts Avenue where I continued my studies until completing my PhD in the spring of 2015. My graduate research allowed me to develop skills in both inorganic and organic synthesis, a variety of analytical techniques with a main focus on cyclic voltammetry, and theoretical studies of reactions using computational methods.</p>

							<h2>Standard Operating Procedures for Cyclic Voltammetry (SOP4CV)</h2>
							<p>After learning the analytical technique of cyclic voltammetry "the hard way," through trial-and-error, asking for advice from more experienced researchers, and consulting dense, math-heavy electrochemistry textbooks, I thought I could make a better reference for people who wanted to learn the technique. SOP4CV has been used as a teaching resource at MIT, Northwestern, Texas A&M, University of Michigan, and UCLA. I recently published it as a book and I am very proud that it is helping others learn practical cyclic voltammetry.</p>
